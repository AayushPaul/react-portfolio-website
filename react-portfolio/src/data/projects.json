With this model, children can learn about everyday objects and animals through image classification, stimulating their cognitive development. This model could definitely be implemented in a well-developed app.",

Through this experience, I not only expanded my knowledge about Python and React, but I also learned about the potential responsibilities or types of tasks Software Engineers complete on a daily basis at JP Morgan Chase & Co. Most importantly, I was able to apply my software engineering skills in a practical setting and gain insights into the financial technology industry. Note: You cannot access my code if you try to click on the 'source' button due to the boilerplate code provided by JP Morgan. I am not allowed to share that code.",
